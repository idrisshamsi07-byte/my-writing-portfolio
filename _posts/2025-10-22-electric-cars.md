Electric vehicles (EVs) have become commonplace in contemporary society with prominent brands adopting them (such as Mercedes and BMW) as well as brands whose entire ideology revolve around these miracle machines (like Tesla and Rivian). They are just brilliant: from the lower servicing and maintenance costs to a reduced carbon footprint, they are a critical aspect of human innovation in the 21st century; however, are they really? What if I were to tell you that not only are EVs much older than they first meets the eye, but they’ve even been around long before even the internal combustion engine!

For starters, we’ve got to go way, way back in time to Scotland in the 1830s. That’s when the first record of a “horseless carriage” was dated to come from scientist Robert Anderson. A carriage that could run completely powered by galvanic cells was a living anachronism in society at the time and was a sign of the great potential of electric power. Nevertheless, despite its potential to be the start of carbon-neutral transport, rechargeable batteries had yet to be invented, so Anderson’s work was dismissed by most as nothing more than a parlour trick. 

Years would pass with more electric vehicles emerging, albeit it was in 1859 where a major breakthrough was made; French chemist Gaston Panté had just invented a lead-acid battery that could be recharged indefinitely while being more powerful than any battery ever used. He demonstrated it to the French Academy of Sciences in 1860, and to this day, many cars still use lead-acid batteries. It was a game-changer as it was the epitome of the concept of being able to store electrical energy, and by 1881, Camille Faure had adapted it to be lighter and longer-lasting for use in automobiles (all he had to do was coat the lead plates in the battery with sulfates to improve their efficiency). Faure’s batteries were so portable that several of them could be installed in an electric carriage without weighing it down. With this breakthrough, the invention of the first proper EV was only a matter of time...

Yet another French scientist, Charles Jeantaud, was the man who we can truly credit with the invention of an EV too. Not only had he made a horseless carriage with rechargeable lead-acid batteries, but he had done so in 1883 – 3 years before Carl Benz had even filed his patent for a gasoline-powered motorcar. Preposterous as it may be, we had EVs before gasoline-powered vehicles, and things were only just starting. 

At the Chicago World Fair in 1893, William Morrison took the spotlight with his prototype automobile, which was an electric-powered buggy with an engine that powered one wheel. Not bad for a Scottish immigrant whose lab was in a basement under a jewellery store in Des Moines! EVs were truly catching the attention of the world, and they were just about to make their next breakthrough: regenerative braking. 

Louis Antoine Krièger, a contemporary of Charles Jeantaud, was an electrical engineer in Paris who was trying to build something for the market of horseless carriages and with a DC motor that he built himself, he constructed his electric carriage with the engine in the front. However, the most shocking thing yet to be seen in EV design was Louis Antoine Krièger regenerative braking: the car could recharge its battery just by using the energy from the movement of the car. Regenerative braking was far ahead of its time, and despite Louis Antoine Krièger’s promising invention, nothing came to fruition. A century later, we see regenerative braking becoming a standard for EVs across the market.

This momentum that we’ve seen since Gaston Panté first made his lead-acid battery just kept growing and growing, with even electric taxicabs on the streets of New York in 1897! EVs were making headlines everywhere they were; in 1899, Camille Jenatzy became the first automobile driver to break the 100 km/h barrier - and he was driving an EV which he called La Jamais Contente (“Never Satisfied”). Henry Ford - the man who made gasoline-powered cars commercially available with the Ford Model T - even bought his wife an EV.

Nevertheless, the fanaticism around EVs gradually faded over time as the much more affordable and reliable gasoline-powered cars took control in the mid-20th century. Car firms did keep experimenting with EVs like General Motors and Cadillac, but that’s all they were - experiments. The lack of lithium-ion batteries, coupled with low range and limited public charging stations, meant EVs simply weren’t a viable form of transport.

That is, until, in 2008, Tesla rekindled the lost dream of electric cars with the Tesla Roadster - an EV powered by lithium-ion batteries with a 200-mile range! Slowly but surely, EVs made their way back into the market and now seem set to take over from gasoline-powered cars with the International Energy Agency predicting that there will be 250 million EVs on the road by 2030 - just shy of 200 years since Robert Anderson’s ‘parlour trick’ that started it all...
