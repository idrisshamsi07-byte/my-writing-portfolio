We’ve all heard of supercomputers in science fiction or in our favourite movies. Still, it’s safe to say those movies won’t be considered “fiction” for much longer with this latest development: exascale computing.

Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors on computer chips doubles every two years, and so every two years, our computers will be capable of higher processing power and better performance—and this is obvious when we compare where we are now compared to the first computers in the mid-20th century. The very first computer humans ever made was the size of a small house and was only ever used by the government, and yet now we all have computers millions of times faster than we carry in our pockets. However, there are still computers the size of small houses—or in some cases small flat blocks—and these are the aforementioned supercomputers. 

Before I elaborate, we need to understand the sheer speed of a supercomputer. Scientists measure this speed in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), which measures how many simple operations, such as addition and multiplication, a computer can do with decimals in a single second. Humans have an average speed of 1 FLOPS, albeit the laptop you’re reading on this now is capable of a few teraFLOPS—that’s one trillion operations per second. However, the very first supercomputer invented in 1964 was already clocking in speeds of approximately 3 megaFLOPS and by 1996, the US Department of Energy had built its Intel ASCI Red supercomputer, which hit the terascale milestone of 1.06 teraFLOPS. Now, that was in 1996, so according to Moore’s Law, we should have supercomputers that are exponentially faster by now. In 2008, a year after Apple launched the first iPhone, the Roadrunner supercomputer was built, and it surpassed the petascale milestone with a speed of 1.026 petaFLOPS—for reference, “peta” is a shorthand for 15 zeros\! And now, we have Frontier.

Frontier was developed in May 2022 in Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and clocked in at—believe it or not—1.1 exaFLOPS. For context, this means we built a computer that can perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 arithmetic operations in one second. Sure, a human could do that many sums, but that human would have to perform one sum every second for the next 31,688,765,000 years. More exascale computers like Frontier have come online and are already hitting double the clock speeds of Frontier: El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California; Aurora at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois; and the JUPITER supercomputer in Germany (which will come online later this year).

You might be wondering at this point why this is so significant. With exascale computing, scientists can now solve impossible problems since these computers have much higher memory, storage, and computing power than a regular laptop. This could drive breakthroughs in several industries such as material science; AI and machine learning; energy production, cancer research; earthquake risk assessment and astrophysics—to name a few. Frontier itself is already being used to simulate the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy by building a computer model so detailed that we can zoom in on individual supernovae, which are around 10 light-years in width. Frontier is also being used to simulate aerodynamics and help engineers understand how to increase fuel efficiency with different-shaped blade designs for the engines and how this correlates to turbulence. The Aurora supercomputer is being used to create maps of the neurons in the brain, and El Capitan is being used to simulate nuclear fusion. 

And let’s not forget, the progress won’t stop here. With the rate supercomputers are being developed, they are predicted to get 10 times faster every four years. Who knows? Maybe we might be carrying computers capable of a few exaFLOPS in our pockets in the near future; the sky's the limit when it comes to the potential computers have to revolutionise our lives.
